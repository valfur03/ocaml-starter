## TL; DR;

This repository contains a minimal yet powerful configuration
for any OCaml project.

To start using it :
1. Configure GitHub Pages to [deploy from GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).
2. Configure your repo on [Codecov](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/quick-start#getting-started).
3. Copy [all the files](https://github.com/valfur03/ocaml-starter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),
   except the _.git_ directory if present, into your newly created repository.
4. Edit the files with the name of your repo.
5. Edit _dune-project_ with the details of your repo.
